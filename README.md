# About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving and managing my growing home network / homelab.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, and general Debian-based distro usage to improve my familiarity with those systems on my home servers.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love movies and I'm always looking for more recommendations!
